            <p>
                My services start at $50 for a basic website. 
                A basic website includes three pages: Home, About, and Contact and one round of edits.
                Additional pages can be added for $20 each and an addtional round of edits can be added for $15.
                Custom projects are priced based on complexity and requirements.
                For more details, please contact me directly.<br>

            <h3>Q&A!</h3>
            <p>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> How long does it take to create a website?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> It typically takes 1-3 weeks to complete a basic website, depending on the complexity and my current workload.<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> What does a round of edits mean?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> A round of edits means you can request changes to the website after the initial design is completed.
                Each round of edits allows for three changes to be made before additional fees apply. <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Note:</span> Certain requests
                may count as multiple depending on how long it would take to complete the task.</strong><br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> Can you create a website for a specific theme or style?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> Yes! I can create websites tailored to specific themes or styles. Just let me know your preferences and we can discuss the details.<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> Do I have to pay upfront or can I pay after the website is done?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> A 50% deposit is required before work begins, with the remaining balance due upon completion of the project. This ensures commitment from both parties.<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> Can you edit a pre-existing website?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> Yes, I can edit and update existing websites. Please provide the details of what you would like to change, and I will give you a quote based on the scope of work!
