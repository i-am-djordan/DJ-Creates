            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>
                My services start at $50 for a basic website. 
                A basic website includes three pages: Home, About, and Contact and one round of edits.
                Additional pages can be added for $20 each and an addtional round of edits can be added for $15.
                Custom projects are priced based on complexity and requirements.
                For more details, please contact me directly.<br>

                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q&A!</span></strong><br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> How long does it take to create a website?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> It typically takes 1-3 weeks to complete a basic website, depending on the complexity and my current workload.<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> What does a round of edits mean?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> A round of edits means you can request changes to the website after the initial design is completed.
                Each round of edits allows for three changes to be made before additional fees apply. <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Note:</span> Certain requests
                may count as multiple depending on how long it would take to complete the task.</strong><br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">Q:</span></strong> Can you create a website for a specific theme or style?<br>
                <strong><span style="color: #c9ada7;">A:</span></strong> Yes! I can create websites tailored to specific themes or styles. Just let me know your preferences and we can discuss the details.
